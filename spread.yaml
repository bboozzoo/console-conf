  # Take the MATCH and REBOOT functions from spread and allow our shell

  # spread-funcs.sh written here, base on the definitions provided by SPREAD.
  # This ensures that 1) spread functions define the code 2) both MATCH and
  # REBOOT are executables and not functions, and can be called from any

  # This is not done in prepare.sh as these variables are not exported,
